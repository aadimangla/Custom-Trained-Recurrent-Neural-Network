<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Using high-level frameworks like Keras, TensorFlow or PyTorch allows us to build very complex models quickly. However, it is worth taking the time to look inside and understand underlying concepts. Not so long ago I published an article, explaining — in a simple way — how neural nets work. However, it was highly theoretical post, dedicated primarily to math, which is the source of NN superpower. From the beginning I was planning to follow-up this topic in a more practical way. This time we will try to utilize our knowledge and build a fully operational neural network using only NumPy. Finally, we will also test our model — solve simple classification problem and compare its performance with NN built with Keras.

Here's why:
* Building a nn from scratch helps in understanding how nn works in the back-end and it is essential for building effective models.


### Built With

This was build using following frameworks, libraries and softwares.
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To run this project you need to follow the following steps.

## Getting Started

To run this project you need to follow the following steps.

### Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites you need to build this bot as well as run it.

```sh
cmd:\ pip install tensorflow
cmd:\ pip install keras
```
#### Extra SETUP
- Create conda environment and create project in this environment
- After installing requirements in above Modules LIST
- You need python idle such as Jupyter notebook or spyder
<!-- #### How to Train ?
- ##### To use default Rasa configs
```sh
$ rasa train
```
- ##### To use spacy config pipeline (Fast to train)
```sh
$ rasa train -c spacy_config.yml
```
-->

<!-- #### How to run 
- ##### To run action server
```sh
$ rasa run actions --actions actionserver.actions
```
- ##### To run rasa in debug mode to inspect slot filling and entities ..,
```sh
$ rasa shell --debug
```
- ##### To run rasa in normal shell
```sh
$ rasa shell
```
